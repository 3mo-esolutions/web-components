# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to 3MO Web Components ðŸ‘‹

3MO started the journey to use Web Components to build its business-suite web applications a while back, and it did wonders for us!

We are now ready to take the next step and develop micro-frontends and components,
to be able to bring Web Components to each and every web-based project, not only our business-suite web applications.
